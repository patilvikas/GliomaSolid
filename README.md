# Plasma Cell-Free DNA Methylome Predicts Response to Combined PARP and Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in IDH-Mutant Glioma: Results of a Phase II Clinical Trial

## Overview

This repository contains analyses and figures from the SOLID clinical trial evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas. The trial investigated treatment responses, survival outcomes, and molecular correlates of response to immunotherapy in this patient population.

The code in this repository reflects analyses associated with the manuscript describing clinical outcomes, genomic profiling, and methylation patterns in IDH-mutant glioma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The R scripts directory contains scripts used to analyze the data and generate figures for the manuscript. Script names correspond to figures (e.g., `figure_1.R` generates all panels for Figure 1).

## Data download

Clinical and molecular data from the SOLID trial can be downloaded from GSEXXXXX (link to be added upon publication).

## Usage

Run individual R scripts to generate specific figure panels. Each script loads its required data from the `data/` directory and outputs figures.

## Repository Structure

- `R/`: Analysis scripts for figure generation
- `data/`: Clinical and molecular data files
